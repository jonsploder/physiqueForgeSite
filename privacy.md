# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 28, 2025**

## Our Privacy Philosophy

At PhysiqueForge, we believe that your fitness data is yours alone. Our approach to privacy is simple: **we don't want your data.** We've built the app to be completely self-contained, ensuring your information never leaves your device unless you choose to share it yourself.

## No Data Collection

PhysiqueForge does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. This includes but is not limited to:
- Names or email addresses
- Location data
- Health or biometric data
- Device identifiers
- Usage statistics

## No Accounts

There are no accounts to create and no passwords to remember. All functionality is available immediately upon installation without any sign-up process.

## Local Storage Only

All workout logs, exercise history, and personal settings are stored locally on your device using a private database. We do not have access to this data, and it is never uploaded to our servers.

> **Note:** Since data is stored only on your device, we cannot recover your workout history if the app is deleted or if your device is lost, unless you have performed a manual backup (if such features are provided).

## No Third-Party Tracking

We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking pixels, or advertising frameworks. Your activity within the app is not monitored by us or any third parties.
