### Frequently Asked Questions

**How does the Dynamic Body Map work?**
The 3D-inspired muscle map visualizes your training readiness. Muscles you've recently trained appear highlighted, while others fade over time, helping you identify which areas are ready for your next session.

**Is my workout data synced to a server?**
No. PhysiqueForge follows a strict privacy-first philosophy: all your workout logs, history, and personal settings are stored locally on your device. We do not collect or have access to your data.

**What is the difference between Compound and Isolation exercises?**
PhysiqueForge automatically categorizes exercises based on muscle involvement. Compound movements target multiple muscle groups (like Squats or Bench Press), while Isolation movements focus on a single muscle (like Bicep Curls).

**How do I track my progress?**
You can view your progress through the Heatmap History, which shows training frequency over time, and the Total Tonnage metric, which tracks the cumulative weight you've lifted.
